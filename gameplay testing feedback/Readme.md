# Some information regarding the feedback

The first 6 feedback forms were collected at the GDAC club meeting using their provided questionairre and feedback forms. I decided to use the same format for the testers outside of GDAC as well.
I circled four questions in the question form that I wanted the playtesters to answer and then let them add anything they wanted (answer another question or add general feedback) in the fifth item.
While at GDAC, some testers only got to test a few minigames and they have mentioned exactly which ones in the game name field, and due to time constraints some testers were unable to answer all 4 questions but still left valuable overall feedback.
